## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Analytics

The analytics system is already initialized in your app. It starts tracking automatically when users visit your app.

### 2. Track Page Views

Wrap your pages with the `AnalyticsTracker` component:

```tsx
import { AnalyticsTracker } from './components/analytics/AnalyticsTracker';

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <AnalyticsTracker pageName="Dashboard">
      {/* Your dashboard content */}
    </AnalyticsTracker>
  );
}
```

### 3. Track User Actions

Use the `TrackedButton` component for important actions:

```tsx
import { TrackedButton } from './components/analytics/AnalyticsTracker';

<TrackedButton 
  action="add_animal"
  metadata={{ animalType: 'cattle', source: 'manual_entry' }}
  onClick={handleAddAnimal}
  className="btn btn-primary"
>
  Add Animal
</TrackedButton>
```

### 4. Track Form Submissions

Use the `TrackedForm` component:

```tsx
import { TrackedForm } from './components/analytics/AnalyticsTracker';

<TrackedForm 
  action="user_signup"
  metadata={{ signupMethod: 'email' }}
  onSubmit={handleSignup}
>
  {/* Your form fields */}
</TrackedForm>
```
